<!-- Challenge: Dice Roller
As a developer, you are tasked with creating a dice application. The application will allow the user to role a standard six-sided dice and see the result of each roll. As the user rolls the dice, each roll gets logged creating a list of all the previous rolls.

pseudocode ->

create a function that gives a random number and logs the previous results and it lists them.

create an array named numberList with the numbers 1 to 6.

create a component that we can click and roll and results

create another component that we can see results and see results continuing
to grow



When creating a project it is important to think about organization of your code. It is best practice to separate and compartmentalize all the actions in your code. The dice UI will be in its own component as will the roll log UI. App.js controls of all the data in state, renders the other components, and passes data to the dice and roll component. -->

<!-- User Stories
As a user, I can see a square box on the screen with a black border and a white background.
As a user, I can click on the box to roll the dice and see the result of my roll in the box.
As a user, I can see my roll logged and see the roll log continue to grow as I roll the dice.
🏔 Stretch Goals
As a user, I can see the image of a dice face when I roll the dice.
As a user, I can click a restart button that clears my roll log. -->
